##Cool R scripts 
Contains scripts for PCA, LDA, logit regressions, and making plots using custom ColorRampFunctions. Also includes a function to generate the `jet` colorscheme. 

[This](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~tpminka/courses/36-350.2001/lectures/day35/) is an awesome link to an MIT course in multivariate clustering. The file `clusterscripts.R` is already from the day 37 lecture of this course, but so far all of the days are looking good.
